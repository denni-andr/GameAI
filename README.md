# Chain Reaction Game using AI bots
Chain Reaction is a multiplayer strategic game that involves making calculated logical moves to conquer the 9 x 16 board with orbs of your color.

The game environment is characterized as a deterministic, fully-observable, discrete, multi-agent (competitive), periodic and turn based environment.

This project aims to emphasize the effectiveness of AI algorithms, using the Minmax algorithm, with alpha - beta pruning to optimize it. 

### Tools Used
Python(Flask) for backend, Phaser - a 2D web framework for creating games (used MIT's base template for Chain Reaction game), Bootstrap (for styling)
